                        <span>The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men.</span>
                        The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. 
                        <span>Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.</span>
                        <a href="#section2">......</a>
                        <span>
                            ......
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="universe" id="section2">
                        <div class="sight" id="one">I have just written the word "infinite".'</div>
                        <div class="sight" id="two">
                         I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. </div>
                         <div class="sight" id="three">Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. 
                         Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. </div>
                         <div class="sight" id="four">
                            I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope.
